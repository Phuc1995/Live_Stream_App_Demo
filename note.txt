- Const: If you have multiple const Color(0xFF00CCFF) in your code, only one instance will be created.
- The implement keyword is used to implement an interface by forcing the redefinition of the functions.
- yield returns values from an Iterable or a Stream.
  yield* is used to recursively call its Iterable or Stream function.
- Equatable
- Const
- Stateless and stateful?
- CrossAxisAlignment.stretch: full view
- ctr + alt + m
- Call native
- Animation
- Dio
- keyboardType: TextInputType.emailAddress: set keyboard support for email format,
- FirestoreService._(); create 1 instance and private contructor
- final id = widget.job?.id ?? documentIdFromCurrentDate();
- typedef ItemWidgetBuilder<T> = Widget Function(BuildContext context, T item); no body
- Widget:
    + Divider():  this represents a divider. Dividers can be used in lists, Drawers, and elsewhere to separate content.,
    + Dismissible(): A widget that can be dismissed by dragging in the indicated direction.
    + Expanded(): expands a child of a Row, Column, or Flex so that the child fills the available space.
    + Placeholder(): This widget is useful during development to indicate that the interface is not yet complete.
    + InkWell() :A rectangular area of a Material that responds to touch.
- CancelableOperation or CancelableCompleter : cancel the future async 2.5.0
-  if (job.ratePerHour > 0.0) ...<Widget>[]
- extension on libary: are a way to add functionality to existing libraries
- Future.wait([])
- @injectable: make sure inject GetIt
- Test:
    - verifyZeroInteractions:
    - String fixtures(String name) => File('test/fixtures/${name}').readAsStringSync();
    - thenAnswer to stub methods that return a Future or Stream
    - TypeMatcher():  Creates a type matcher for the given type parameter.
    - await untilCalled():
    -  expectLater(bloc.state, emitsInAnyOrder(expected));:       final expected = [
                                          Empty(),

                                        ];

 - @immutable:
 - get_it:
    + Class requiring cleanup(such as Blocs) shouldn't be registered as singletons
    + LazySingleton: is registered when is requested
    + @LazySingleton(as: IAuthFacade)
 - clean new technical from medium

 -BLoc:
    - BlocConsumer
    - BlocListener

 DDD
 - Infrastructure:
    + Repositories: capture the try catch and failure from to API
 - Freezed:
    + Freezed is a code generation package that offers many useful features. From sealed unions, to pattern matching, to json serialization
    + Immutability makes it easier to reason about the code
    + Immutable objects are thread-safe
    + Preventing illegal states by validating the state at the constructor
    + flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
 - Error.safeToString('$explation Failure was: $valueFailure') :The conversion is guaranteed to not throw, so it won't use the object's toString method.
